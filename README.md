<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Main Page](https://i.imgur.com/GeZle2M.png)

We were tasked with creating a website that acted as a "Self-Care-Center" where a user could click on either an affirmation button or a mantra button and the user would receive a randomly generated message based on the category they selected. My CYOA featuer was the "delete" button, so that when a user clicks on receiving a message, they are allowed to delete the message from the list so that it no longer appears.

User navigates to the homepage and selects either an affirmation or mantra button.
